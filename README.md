****BDD with Selenium and C#****

This project demonstrates a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach using Selenium with C# for automated browser testing. It incorporates various design patterns and practices to ensure robust and maintainable test automation.

**Key Features:**

- BDD with Selenium and C#: Utilizes SpecFlow to define test scenarios in Gherkin syntax, integrated with Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

- Factory Design Pattern: Implements a Factory design pattern to manage and initialize WebDriver instances for different browsers (Chrome, Firefox) based on configuration.

- Page Object Model: Follows the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to create a clear separation between test logic and page-specific interactions, enhancing maintainability and readability.

- log4net Integration: Configures log4net for comprehensive logging of test execution. Logs are generated for each step to provide detailed insights and facilitate debugging.

- Screenshot on Failure: Automatically captures screenshots when test cases fail, allowing for visual inspection and easier identification of issues.

- Hooks Implementation: Uses SpecFlow hooks ([BeforeScenario], [AfterScenario]) to manage WebDriver lifecycle, including initialization and cleanup, ensuring a clean test environment.


****Necessary Installation for the Repository****

**1. .NET SDK**

  - EdgeDriver: For Microsoft Edge.
- Note: WebDriver binaries can be managed through NuGet packages or downloaded manually from their respective websites.
- 
**5. Browser Installation**
- Description: Ensure that the browsers you intend to test against (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) are installed on your machine.

**6. Configuration Files**

- Description: The project uses configuration files (e.g., appsettings.json) for managing settings such as browser type.
Installation: Ensure these files are correctly set up in the root directory of the project.
